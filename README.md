# sam-app: Thumbnail Generator
The provided SAM (Serverless Application Model) template deploys a thumbnail generator service on AWS Lambda triggered by S3 events. Here's a summary:

**Description**: This SAM template defines a serverless application named "sam-app".

**Resources**:
- **StoritmpBucket**: An S3 bucket named "storitmp" is created.
- **ThumbnailGeneratorFunction**: A Lambda function named "ThumbnailGeneratorFunction" is defined. It generates thumbnails for images uploaded to the S3 bucket and saves them to the "outputs" directory.
- **ApplicationResourceGroup**: An AWS Resource Group is created for monitoring purposes.
- **ApplicationInsightsMonitoring**: AWS Application Insights is configured for monitoring the application.

**Outputs**: 
- **ThumbnailGeneratorApi**: Provides the API Gateway endpoint URL for accessing the Thumbnail Generator function.
- **ThumbnailGeneratorFunction**: ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the Thumbnail Generator Lambda function.
- **ThumbnailGeneratorFunctionIamRole**: ARN of the IAM role created for the Thumbnail Generator Lambda function.

**Functionality**:
- The `lambda_handler` function in the `app.py` file handles S3 events triggered by image uploads into the `inputs/` directory.
- Upon receiving an S3 event, the function generates a thumbnail image from the uploaded image and saves it to the `outputs/` directory within the same S3 bucket.
- If successful, the function returns a response indicating the successful generation and upload of the thumbnail image.
- If an error occurs during the process, an appropriate error message is returned with a status code of 500.

This setup allows for the automatic generation of thumbnail images whenever new images are uploaded to the specified S3 bucket.

## Strengths and weaknesses of the architecture

Strengths:
- **Serverless Deployment**: AWS SAM simplifies the deployment process for serverless applications.
- **Scalability**: AWS Lambda automatically scales to handle varying workloads, ensuring application performance.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Pay only for the compute time consumed by your functions, which can result in cost savings compared to traditional server-based architectures.
- **Integration**: SAM integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, allowing for easy orchestration of complex workflows.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The application is event-driven, responding to events such as HTTP requests and S3 object creations (`s3:ObjectCreated:*`), which allows for asynchronous and loosely coupled components.

Weaknesses:
- **Cold Start**: AWS Lambda functions may experience a cold start delay, impacting the latency of the first request.
- **Complexity**: SAM templates can become complex as applications grow in size and complexity, requiring careful management and optimization.
